      <description>A couple of years ago, I invested into a solar energy system, which is mounted on my roof and can produce 4kw peak. As of writing this article I already produced 35 mega watt energy for my house.
The inverter is a Fronius Symo 3.7 and has LAN as well as WIFI in order to show the current produced energy. The WIFI can be configured by directly connecting a PC with a LAN cable.</description>
