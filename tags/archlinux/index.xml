      <description>I am currently waiting for my new machine, which I ordered 2 weeks ago. After a lot of research and evaluation, I finally decided to pick the Lenovo T490s. I actually wanted the X1 Carbon, but I was unable to order this machine here in Austria (for whatever reason).
Nevertheless, the T490s is pretty close to the X1, and delivers a decent platform for my new Archlinux installation. While I am waiting for the delivery (expected date end of next week), I am mentally prepare myself with a new and fresh Arch installation.</description>
