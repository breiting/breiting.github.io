      <description>On my Arch system, docker does not expose the tcp port by default, therefore I get the following error:
Warning: failed to get default registry endpoint from daemon (Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at tcp://192.168.0.16:2375. Is the docker daemon running?). Using system default: https://index.docker.io/v1/ Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at tcp://192.168.0.16:2375. Is the docker daemon running? It took me quite some time to get the root cause of the problem.</description>

      <description>In the last years, I tried get more efficient by removing bloated software on my machine. Some of you may know that I am running Arch Linux, which builds the basis for my daily activities. On top of it, the terminal is my main working area. Last year I switched from traditional window managers to the tiling window manager dwm. Tiling window managers have the advantage that your screen is not messed up with floating windows which need to be moved, resized using the mouse.</description>

      <description>As a heavy shell user, I typically try to reduce the number of keystrokes required to fulfill a certain task. As I am working a lot with remote machines, I am logging into those machines pretty often.
Problem statement In order to log into a remote machine, I am using the ssh command. The typical command is ssh &amp;lt;user&amp;gt;@192.168.0.123, if the user is named differently on the other machine. I am often facing the following problems:</description>

      <description>Joining a new software development team typically means new coding guidelines and rules. If you are lucky and no guidelines are in place, it is your obligation to take care and define them. To my opinion, coding guidelines make sense and are important for the product quality. They deliver a good foundation for collaborative developments and easy maintenance. I am not talking about a 50 pager, where everything is defined - no - only the most important things should be part of the guideline, for example:</description>

      <description>I recently discovered the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; programming language Go and really got my attention. Go was announced in November 2009 and the first version (v1.0) was released in March 2012. Go has strong influence from the C programming language but brings some cool features:
 Statically typed and scalable to large systems (like Java or C++) Productive and readable, without excessive boilerplate Not requiring integrated development environments (nice VIM integration :-) Supporting networking and multiprocessing  Mandatory for every programming language, there is my first Go program (main.</description>
