      <description>In the last years, I tried get more efficient by removing bloated software on my machine. Some of you may know that I am running Arch Linux, which builds the basis for my daily activities. On top of it, the terminal is my main working area. Last year I switched from traditional window managers to the tiling window manager dwm. Tiling window managers have the advantage that your screen is not messed up with floating windows which need to be moved, resized using the mouse.</description>

      <description>As a heavy shell user, I typically try to reduce the number of keystrokes required to fulfill a certain task. As I am working a lot with remote machines, I am logging into those machines pretty often.
Problem statement In order to log into a remote machine, I am using the ssh command. The typical command is ssh &amp;lt;user&amp;gt;@192.168.0.123, if the user is named differently on the other machine. I am often facing the following problems:</description>

      <description>Joining a new software development team typically means new coding guidelines and rules. If you are lucky and no guidelines are in place, it is your obligation to take care and define them. To my opinion, coding guidelines make sense and are important for the product quality. They deliver a good foundation for collaborative developments and easy maintenance.

 Statically typed and scalable to large systems (like Java or C++) Productive and readable, without excessive boilerplate Not requiring integrated development environments (nice VIM integration :-) Supporting networking and multiprocessing  Mandatory for every programming language, there is my first Go program (main.</description>
