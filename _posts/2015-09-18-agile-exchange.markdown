Agile is cool; agile helps to develop better software tailored to customers'
needs. On September 17th, <a href="http://www.jipp.it"
target="_blank">JIPP.IT</a> invited to the first <a
href="http://www.experten.cc/home" target="_blank">Agile Competence ExChange
  workshop</a> in Graz.  I had the chance to participate at this well-organized
  event.

<!--more-->Mag.a Erika <a href="http://www.kkwico.at" target="_blank">Krenn-Neuwirth</a> started with a keynote speech about agile leadership and addresses the importance of bringing agile thinking in the heads of managers. Agile leaders empower their team, build trust, and make progress of the team visible. Agile managers keep a close collaboration with each individual by scheduling regular 1on1s (this is the simplest but still the less used method of managers today). Agile leaders reduce the time for administrative work, and spend more time in strategic thinking. The talk closed with two important statements:
<ol>
<li>If something is working, do not change, and make more of it</li>
<li>If something is not working, change it</li>
</ol>

Being agile means that you are able to address problems quickly, change
something, and see if the result is better than before.

Besides the interesting keynote, <a href="http://www.experten.cc/workshops"
target="_blank">5 agile experts</a> offered small workshop sessions. <a
href="https://stwunder.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Stefan Wunder</a> talked
about ALASKA which is a program introduced at <a href="https://www.avl.com"
target="_blank">AVL</a> to use Scrum for their developments at enterprise
scale. <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Rene_Pachernegg"
target="_blank">Rene Pachernegg</a> talked about the <a
href="http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-vision-board/"
target="_blank">Product Vision Board </a>and the experiences <a
href="http://apus.co.at" target="_blank">APUS</a> made with it. <a
href="http://www.businesskonsens.eu/home-2/uber-business-konsens/"
target="_blank">Erich Visotschnig</a> addressed an alternative approach for
making decisions within agile teams. <a
href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Helmut_Steiner" target="_blank">Helmut
Steineder</a> presented the methods and concepts of agile testing. To my
opinion, a big topic which is important for every software engineering team.
Finally, <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Philipp_Eisbacher2"
target="_blank">Philipp Eisbacher</a> talked about tools which can help to
improve companies being agile.

The workshop participants had the chance to register for three sessions each
one taking 15 (10+5) minutes.

The last session invited for networking while getting great food and drinks.
Participants had the chance to continue the discussions with experts informally
and in a well embedded environment.

My conclusion: thanks to the organisers, this was a really great event where
agile thinkers and enthusiasts had the chance to exchange and learn from each
other. Looking forward to the second ExChange workshop.
