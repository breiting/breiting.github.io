Another year passed, and I am looking back to a very successful business year.
Besides our customer projects, we also refurbished our web page (<a
    href="http://www.reecon.at" target="_blank">http://www.reecon.at</a>)
giving a good overview about our portfolio. Actually this blog is also a result
of this year's activities.

What can we expect from 2016? Here are my top 3 on my list:
<ol>
<li>I want to invest in new resources for my company.</li>
<li>I want to get to aÂ paperless office.</li>
<li>I want to increase my blogging interval.</li>
</ol>

Christmas it the time to recharge batteries, and to reflect the passed year,
but also to think about the future.

I wish you Merry Christmas and a happy new year 2016.
